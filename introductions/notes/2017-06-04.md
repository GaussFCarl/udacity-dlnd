# Lesson #5 - regression

- supervised learning
  - have data & labels
  - feedback every move
- unsupervised learning:
  - have data, no labels
  - no feedback
  - better with unlabeled
  - no feedback
- reinforcement learning: have
  - isn't given feedback each step
  - feedback upon completion of objective


- when data is labeled, can use supervised learning
- linear regression models independent + dependent variable
