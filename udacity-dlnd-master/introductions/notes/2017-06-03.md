## first attempt

- crank everything! (didn't save numbers)
- added 4 rlu layers with around 1000 neurons
- very non-deterministic performance
- didn't understand model
- read the docs!

## second attempt

#### tradeoffs

- larger input provides more info
- makes it harder to learn relevant parts
- may require longer training times

### tunable parameters

#### car visibility

```js
lanesSide = 0;
patchesAhead = 1;
patchesBehind = 0;
```

#### training

```js
trainIterations = 10000;
```

#### temporal window?

```js
temporal_window = 3;
```

#### hidden layers

```js
layer_defs.push({
    type: 'fc',
    num_neurons: 1,
    activation: 'relu'
});
```

looked up activation functions a relu seems best for beginner case


### run1 - random drive

#### max visibility

```js
lanesSide = 6;
patchesAhead = 10;
patchesBehind = 10;
trainIterations = 10000;
```

#### observations

- still just one neuron
- doesn't change lanes
- given one nueron is probably just stop/go?

#### increase number of neurons

```js
layer_defs.push({
    type: 'fc',
    num_neurons: 100,
    activation: 'relu'
});
```

#### observations

- changes lanes inferquently
- still just rides behind one car and passes

#### evaluate

avg speed: 55.47mph


#### conclusions

- not very good
- probably undertrained
- probably don't need to look so far behind
- want to experiment with more layers
- more and less neurons

### run2 - training montage

```js
trainIterations = 50000;
```

#### observations

- taking quite some time to train

#### evaluate

- avg speed: 55.04 mph
- extra training didn't help

### run3 - vision

```js
lanesSide = 6;
patchesAhead = 20;
patchesBehind = 8;
```

- huge input! 1471

#### observations

- training is slow
- not really sure what the red graph is
- the boxes below appear to be the neural network, but so far only useful for understanding the input size
- starting to get impatient on the training...
- still not changing lanes
- going to reload page


### run4 - restart

#### input
```js
lanesSide = 6;
patchesAhead = 20;
patchesBehind = 8;
trainIterations = 20000;
```

#### layers
```js
layer_defs.push({
    type: 'fc',
    num_neurons: 10,
    activation: 'relu'
});
```

#### observations

- not great at changing lanes
- maxes speed in open road


#### evaluation

avg speed: 54.94

#### conclusions

10 neurons did as well as 100 !


### run 5 - go deep

#### input
```js
lanesSide = 6;
patchesAhead = 20;
patchesBehind = 8;
trainIterations = 20000;
```

#### layers
```js
layer_defs.push({
    type: 'fc',
    num_neurons: 500,
    activation: 'relu'
});
layer_defs.push({
    type: 'fc',
    num_neurons: 500,
    activation: 'relu'
});
```

##### observations
made the net way too big
let's trim this all down a bit


### run 6 - conservative


#### input
```js
lanesSide = 5;
patchesAhead = 10;
patchesBehind = 2;
trainIterations = 10000;
```


#### layers
```js
layer_defs.push({
    type: 'fc',
    num_neurons: 10,
    activation: 'relu'
});
```

#### observations

- doing just as well as the big net!
- still getting stuck
- wondering what the appropriate tradeoffs are

#### evaluation

avg speed: 56.6

#### conclusions

- now seeing a bit of lane changin
- remember i have to be patient for traning to happen
- bigger isn't always better
- esp b.c training is compute AND memory bound


### run 7 - small steps

#### input
```js
lanesSide = 5;
patchesAhead = 15;
patchesBehind = 2;
trainIterations = 20000;
```

763 bits

#### layers
```js
layer_defs.push({
    type: 'fc',
    num_neurons: 10,
    activation: 'relu'
});
layer_defs.push({
    type: 'fc',
    num_neurons: 10,
    activation: 'relu'
});
```

#### observations

#### conclusions

avg speed: 51.01 mph!!


### run - have no idea

#### input
```js
lanesSide = 5;
patchesAhead = 5;
patchesBehind = 2;
trainIterations = 10000;
```

    num_neurons: 8,
    activation: 'relu'
